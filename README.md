# matrix
MicroMatrix is a small Python3 package which adds a generalised `Matrix()` class for matrix maths with no external dependancies.

You can create matrices of any size: 1x1, 2x4, 3x3, or whatever you want.
```python
from micromatrix import Matrix

my_matrix = Matrix([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6)

# do stuff with my_matrix
```
